#### <span>## Inspiration</span>





<span>A few months ago, having a beer with our colleagues, we had a heated debate about how to maintain team motivation and morale. We needed to consider the evolution of working conditions, such as remote working and the growing trend for distributed teams. Despite disagreements on several points, we all agreed on one key point - it's extremely important to encourage active team collaboration, cultivate a helping mindset, and work with engineers' recognition as a critical part of building a cooperative company culture.&nbsp;</span>



<span>But how can we let our colleagues know that we highly appreciate their contribution?</span>

<span>Buy them a coffee? Send them a present?&nbsp;</span>



<span>Showing appreciation to a diverse group of employees isn't easy, especially if your colleague is from another continent. And that’s how the idea of the blockchain-based motivation system “Enthusiasm” was born.</span>

#### <span>## What it does</span>



<span>Enthusiasm provides a set of tools that help to maintain team motivation and promote the power of small actions within a team:</span>

- <span>Rewards. This functionality helps to thank any of the teammates in your Slack workspace by sending them some amount of Near tokens.&nbsp;</span>

- <span>Award nomination. This functionality provides the ability to nominate any teammate for a reward at the end of a working period (sprint/month/year). Nomination represents some titles like "The most valuable player", "Soul of a Team" etc, and the number of the Near protocol tokens as a monetary reward. Teammates can vote for their nominees with the help of the Near blockchain, which makes this process completely easy and transparent.</span>


#### <span>## How we built it</span>



- <span>Near part - combination of smart contract written with Rust and JS part with Near SDK, which help bot to communicate with the blockchain</span>

- <span>Slack bot - Slack part was implemented with the help of pure JS and Slack API (hell, not the best organized one)</span>


#### <span>## Challenges we ran into</span>



- <span>no experience with any blockchain development</span>

- <span>no experience with Near Protocol</span>

- <span>Lack of experience with Rust and Slack API</span>

- <span>Lack of good coffee&nbsp;</span>

- <span>lack of concentration due to the constant geopolitical analyses of the geopolitical situation in world and Ukraine specifically :)&nbsp;</span>


#### <span>## Accomplishments that we're proud of</span>



- <span>In a short period of time, we dived deep into blockchain development, learned a totally new programming language.&nbsp;</span>

- <span>There were a lot of iterations, discussions, and problems, but eventually, we managed to build a small, but useful real-life application</span>


#### <span>## What we learned</span>



- <span>Rust</span>

- <span>Near SDK</span>

- <span>Near API</span>

- <span>Blockchain concepts&nbsp;</span>

- <span>Near best practices</span>

- <span>Slack API</span>
